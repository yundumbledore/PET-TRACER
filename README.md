PET-TRACER is an open-source Python framework designed to bring state-of-the-art Bayesian kinetic parameter estimation to dynamic total-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. At its core, PET-TRACER implements a novel generative consistency model (CM) pipeline that accelerates posterior inference of two-tissue compartment parameters—namely $K_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$, and blood volume fraction $V_b$—from time–activity curves (TACs) and arterial input functions (AIFs). By collapsing what traditionally requires hundreds of denoising steps into just three highly optimized U-Net passes, PET-TRACER enables rapid, high-fidelity sampling of per-voxel kinetic posteriors, paving the way for truly quantitative, uncertainty-aware parametric imaging at whole-body scale.
